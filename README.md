# Scripts
Developed in the realm of the [NIE-INE](http://www.fee.unibas.ch/nie_ine.html) project.
For different scientific edition projects in the Humanities at the Basel University a series of extra- and interdependent vocabularies or ontologies are created, to express data and metadata in a formal machine-readable way. Formal here means adhering to the [model theory of W3C RDF, RDFS](https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-mt-20020429/), and [OWL Full](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/).  
E.g. Python scripts are created to migrate data from their original source, e.g. a MySQL relational database, to a JSON format to import data in the Knora RDF triple store, see figure.
